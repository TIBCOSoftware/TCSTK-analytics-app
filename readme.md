### Starters Toolkit for TIBCO Cloud™ - Analytics App
TCSTK Pattern - Analytics App, is a sample that just connects TIBCO Cloud™ Spotfire.

The Pattern application **Analytics App**, contains the essentials to open a Spotfire Dashbord and take action. It is based on the Spotfire Implementation stored here, and known as [Spotfire Wrapper](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/spotfire-wrapper).

**Note**<br>
This Pattern App is using some Services Offerings of the TIBCO Cloud™ Live Apps Subscription, e.g. Shared State to store Application Configurations.
Also if the App should be hosted on TIBCO Cloud™, a TIBCO Cloud™ Live Apps Subscription is needed to upload the App to the Web Resource Provisioning Service.
